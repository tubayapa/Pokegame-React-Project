## Pokegame React Project


## Description:
This is a React-based web application that simulates a Pokémon battle game. The game divides a set of Pokémon into two hands, calculates their total experience points, and determines the winner based on which hand has the higher total experience. Each Pokémon card displays its image, name, type, and experience points. The winning hand is highlighted with a "Winner!" button, while the losing hand is labeled with a "Loser!" button.
